# DETAILS

- `pager` & `pager-indicators` code is a Multiplatform version of [Accompanist Pager](https://github.com/google/accompanist/tree/main/pager/src/main/java/com/google/accompanist/pager)
- `snapper` code is a Multiplatform version of the [Snapper library](https://github.com/chrisbanes/snapper)

*Note*: `snapper` has been deprecated in favour of new [SnapFlingBehaviour](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/gestures/snapping/SnapFlingBehavior) API in Compose 1.3.0
It has to be migrated once `Compose Multiplatform` reaches `1.3.0`
